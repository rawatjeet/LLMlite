## 1. PGWP ELIGIBILITY & APPLICATION FOR YORK UNIVERSITY GRADUATES

### 1.1 York University PGWP Eligibility

**Good news:** All York University degree programs (undergraduate and postgraduate) are automatically PGWP-eligible. This includes your biomedical degree.[1][2]

**Key PGWP Requirements:**

- ✓ Your program is an academic degree at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI)
- ✓ You studied full-time in each term (with limited exceptions for breaks and leaves)
- ✓ Your program is at least 8 months long
- ✓ You have completed the program and received an official completion letter

**Important Note:** You do NOT need to show a field-of-study match for degree programs—all bachelor's, master's, and PhD degrees qualify for PGWP, regardless of field.

**Official Reference:** York International PGWP Webinar & Guide  
https://yorkinternational.yorku.ca/ (Search for "PGWP" or "Post-Graduation Work Permit")

---

### 1.2 PGWP Application Steps

#### **Step 1: Get Your Completion Documentation (Timeline: Upon graduation)**

- Both documents should clearly state the completion date and full program name

**Contact:** York University Registrar  
📧 registrar@yorku.ca  
🌐 https://www.yorku.ca/student-centre/registration-and-records/

---

#### **Step 2: Know the 180-Day Deadline (Timeline: Critical)**

- You MUST apply for PGWP within **180 calendar days** of receiving written confirmation that you completed your program
- This means: If you complete June 15, 2026, you must apply by December 12, 2026
- **Best practice:** Apply immediately after you receive your completion letter

---

#### **Step 3: Set Up Your IRCC Secure Account (Timeline: 1-2 days)**

- Create a Canada.ca login account and link it to your Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) account
- Go to: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/apply-next-steps.html
- You will need:
  - Valid email address
  - Proof of identity (valid passport)

**Create account here:**  
https://login.canada.ca/ (Select "Create an account")

---

#### **Step 4: Gather Required Documents (Timeline: 2-3 weeks)**

Prepare these documents in digital format (PDF/JPG, under 4 MB each):

| Document | Details |

---

#### **Step 5: Determine PGWP Duration & Calculate Fees (Timeline: Immediate)**

**PGWP Duration Formula:**

- **PGWP length = Study program length (up to maximum)**
- Maximum PGWP: **3 years** (36 months)
- Examples:
  - Completed 2-year biomedical diploma → Eligible for 2-year PGWP
  - Completed 4-year bachelor's → Eligible for 3-year PGWP (capped)
  - Completed 1.5-year program → Eligible for 1.5-year PGWP

**PGWP Fees (2025-2026):**

- Processing fee: **CAD $255**
- Biometric fee (if required): **CAD $85**
- Open work permit holder fee: **CAD $100**
- **Total typical cost: CAD $440**

**Payment:** Pay online through your IRCC account at the time of submission

**Fee Payment & Current Rates:**  
https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/fees.html

---

#### **Step 6: Complete PGWP Application Online (Timeline: 1-2 hours)**

**Online Application Steps:**

1. Log in to your IRCC secure account
2. Go to "Apply" or "Submit an application"
3. Select "Post-Graduation Work Permit" (or "Work in Canada" → "After graduation")
4. Answer eligibility questions:
   - When did you complete your studies?
   - What is the length of your program?
   - Do you have valid study permit status?
   - Are you currently in Canada or outside Canada?
5. Upload all required documents in the order listed in Step 4
6. Review your application thoroughly
7. Pay fees online
8. Submit application

**IRCC Application Portal:**  
https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/apply-next-steps.html

---

#### **Step 7: Receive Your PGWP & Work Authorization (Timeline: 2-4 weeks typical)**

- You will receive a notification in your IRCC account when a decision is made
- Your PGWP approval letter will include:
  - Your work authorization document (a letter)
  - PGWP expiration date
  - Conditions (usually work anywhere in Canada, for any employer)

**Keep the approval letter safe—it is your proof of work authorization.**

If you are inside Canada when approved, you may start working immediately upon receiving the letter.

---

### 1.3 PGWP Validity & What You Can Do

**Your PGWP is valid for:**
- Working for any employer in Canada
- Any type of work (not restricted to healthcare, though recommended for PR planning)
- Renewing it if you have another approved program and haven't yet used up total study permit time

**Your PGWP is NOT valid for:**
- Studying a new program without explicit permission (unless you get a new study permit before PGWP expires)
- Staying in Canada after expiry unless you transition to another status (PR, new study permit, etc.)

---

### 1.4 Important: PGWP and Study Permit Relationship

- Once you apply for PGWP after graduation, your **study permit automatically becomes invalid**
- If your PGWP application is approved, your work authorization replaces your study permit
- **Do NOT extend your study permit while you are applying for PGWP unless you have a new program confirmed and plan to pursue it before graduating**

---

## 2. STUDY PERMIT EXTENSION & SECOND HEALTH PROGRAMS IN ONTARIO

### 2.1 Decision: PGWP Route vs. Extended Study Route

You have two main pathways after completing your biomedical degree at York:

| Pathway | Timeline | PGWP Use | Next Steps |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Route A: PGWP First (Recommended)** | Apply PGWP after graduation, work 1-2 years, then apply for PR or new program | Uses PGWP | Work in healthcare field, gain CEC experience, apply for PR or second program later |
| **Route B: Continue Studying** | Before graduating, extend study permit for second health program (dental hygiene, radiology, etc.), no PGWP gap | Saves PGWP for end | Apply new program now, graduate, then use PGWP for work after final program |

**Recommendation:** Route A (PGWP first) is more common because:
- PGWP is typically issued once per person
- Using it after your HIGHEST credential (e.g., after a bachelor's + a diploma) is strategic
- Working 1 year on PGWP qualifies you for Express Entry CEC
- You can still apply for a second program via new study permit after PGWP, if desired

---

### 2.2 Study Permit Extension for a Second Program

If you choose Route B (continue studying), here's how to extend your study permit for a second health program:

#### **2.2.1 When to Apply**

- Apply **at least 3 months (ideally 4-5 months) before your current study permit expires**
- Your current study permit must be valid at the time you submit the extension application
- Applying early gives you breathing room; late applications risk falling out of status

**Timeline Example:**
- Current study permit expires: August 31, 2026
- You should apply: April-May 2026 (3-4 months before expiry)

---

#### **2.2.2 Get Acceptance Letter from Second Program**

**Priority Health Programs in Ontario (PGWP-eligible):**

---

#### **2.2.3 Prepare Proof of Financial Support**

IRCC requires proof that you can pay for tuition + living expenses for the new program.

**Financial Requirements for Study Permit (approximate):**

| Category | Amount (CAD) |
|----------|--------------|
| **College Program (2-3 years)** | $15,000–$25,000/year tuition + $20,000–$25,000/year living expenses = $35,000–$50,000 total per year |
| **Dentistry Bachelor's** | $30,000–$40,000/year tuition + $20,000–$25,000/year living expenses = $50,000–$65,000 total per year |

**Acceptable Proof of Funds:**

- ✓ Bank statements (Canada or home country) showing money in your account
- ✓ Education loan sanction letter from a Canadian bank or home-country bank
- ✓ Affidavit of support from parents/sponsor (notarized)
- ✓ Proof of scholarship or bursary award letter
- ✓ Line of credit approval from a Canadian bank
- ✓ Combination of above (e.g., some savings + loan)

**Recommended approach:** Combine 2-3 sources (e.g., savings + loan + possible family support) to show strong financial position.

## 4. PROVINCIAL NOMINEE PROGRAM (PNP) & OINP STREAMS FOR INTERNATIONAL GRADUATES

### 4.1 What is the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP)?

The **OINP** is Ontario's pathway to Permanent Residence (PR) for skilled workers, including international graduates and healthcare professionals. As an Ontario graduate with a health-related education, you are a strong candidate.

**Key Point:** OINP can nominate you for PR even if your Express Entry score is lower than other candidates, because being nominated gives you an additional 600 points in Express Entry.

---

### 4.2 OINP Streams Available for You (2025)

The OINP is undergoing restructuring in 2025–2026. Below are the current streams and proposed changes.

#### **Current OINP Streams (2025):**

| Stream | Eligibility | Requirements | Timeline |
|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Human Capital Priorities Stream** | Anyone in Express Entry pool | Be in Express Entry, meet language requirements, score qualifies | ~2–3 weeks (Express Entry timeline) |
| **Employer Job Offer: Foreign Worker Stream** | Anyone with valid job offer | Job offer from Ontario employer, position meets criteria, language/education match | ~4–8 weeks |
| **Employer Job Offer: International Mobility Program Stream** | Anyone with job offer under IMP | Job offer + employer sponsorship | ~4–8 weeks |
| **Healthcare Professional Stream (Proposed 2025–2026)** | Healthcare professionals with/without job offer | Registration with regulatory body OR recent graduate finalizing registration | TBD (new) |

**Healthcare Priority:** OINP prioritizes healthcare occupations, including:
- Registered nurses (NOC 31301)
- Nurses with specialty training
- Medical laboratory technologists
- Medical radiation technologists (NOC 32121)
- **Dental hygienists (NOC 32111)** ← You if you pursue dental hygiene
- Respiratory therapists
- Other regulated healthcare professions

---

### 4.3 OINP Stream Details Relevant to You

#### **Stream 1: Human Capital Priorities Stream (via Express Entry)**

**What it is:** Special draws targeted at healthcare and tech workers already in Express Entry.

**How it works:**
1. You create an Express Entry profile (see Section 5)
2. You enter the Express Entry pool with your score
3. OINP conducts special "healthcare draws" and invites eligible candidates
4. If invited, you submit a OINP application (~2 weeks online)
5. If nominated, OINP adds 600 points to your Express Entry score
6. You then apply for PR with the nomination (fast-tracked through Express Entry)

**Eligibility for this stream:**
- Must be in Express Entry pool (CEC, FSW, or Canadian Experience Class)
- Have healthcare-related education or credentials
- Meet minimum language requirements (CLB 7–8+ depending on draw)
- Typically for candidates with 1+ year of Canadian work experience (CEC route)

**Timeline:**

2. Employer submits supporting documentation
3. You submit OINP application with job offer letter, credentials, etc.
4. OINP reviews and nominates you
5. You apply for PR

**Eligibility:**
- Valid job offer from Ontario employer
- Job must be in a skill level recognized by OINP (usually NOC TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3—yours will qualify)

## 5. EXPRESS ENTRY & CANADIAN EXPERIENCE CLASS (CEC) PATHWAY

### 5.1 What is Express Entry?

**Express Entry** is the federal system for managing applications for:
- Canadian Experience Class (CEC) — for people with Canadian work experience
- Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) — for skilled workers globally
- Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) — for trades workers

**For you (international grad in Canada):** CEC is your main federal route after you have 1 year of Canadian work experience.

---

### 5.2 Canadian Experience Class (CEC) — Your Likely Federal Route

**What is CEC?**
- Federal pathway to PR for people who have Canadian work experience
- Managed through Express Entry system
- No province required (but OINP nomination boosts your chances significantly)

**CEC Eligibility:**

   - Candidates with highest CRS are selected
   - If you're selected, you get an **ITA (Invitation to Apply)**
   - ITA validity: 60 days
   - Timeline: Days to months (depends on your CRS and current draw cut-offs)

**Full CEC Timeline:**
- 1 year work (PGWP) + language test (1–2 months) + Express Entry creation (1 day) + waiting for draw (variable, weeks to months) + PR application (2 months to submit) + IRCC processing (6 months) = **18–24 months typical**

### 5.3 Express Entry CRS Calculation (Simplified)

Your CRS score (out of 1,600) is calculated as:

| Factor | Max Points | Your Likely Points | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Age** (25–35) | 100 | 100 | You likely benefit |
| **Education** (Bachelor's degree) | 128 | 128 | York degree ✓ |
| **Language Ability** (CLB 7 in English) | 136 | ~100–136 | Depends on test score; higher is better |
| **Canadian Work Experience** (1 year) | 100 | 100 | Necessary minimum |
| **Arranged Employment (Job Offer)** | 200 | 0 or 200 | If you have confirmed offer = +200 ✓ |
| **Other factors** (spouse, credentials) | Variable | Variable | Spouse education/language adds points |
| | | **Estimated Total** | **428–664** (wide range; depends on language score & job offer) |

**Competitive CRS Scores (recent draws):**
- CEC-only draws: 450–520
- CEC + FSWP draws: 470–550
- CEC + FSWP + FSTP draws: 480–560

## 10. FINAL NOTES & IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### ✅ Do This Now:

1. ✓ Meet with York International Office to confirm your PGWP eligibility (should be automatic for bachelor's)
2. ✓ Make a decision: PGWP first vs. continue studying (Route A vs. Route B)
3. ✓ If Route B: Research dental hygiene, radiology, etc. programs and their prerequisites/admission dates
4. ✓ Start gathering documents: transcripts, identification, etc.
5. ✓ Consider booking a language test (IELTS/CELPIP) for spring 2026
6. ✓ Save this document and share with parents/supporters for reference

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes:

1. ❌ Waiting until graduation to think about PGWP (start planning now)
2. ❌ Missing the 180-day PGWP deadline (apply IMMEDIATELY after completion letter)
3. ❌ Extending study permit too late (must apply while current permit is valid)
4. ❌ Not documenting employment (keep ALL pay stubs, employment letters for PR later)
5. ❌ Overlooking language test requirements (needed for Express Entry & OINP)
6. ❌ Assuming you don't need proof of funds (you do for study permit extension)
7. ❌ Not exploring OINP healthcare streams (fast-track to PR as healthcare worker)

### ℹ️ Helpful Tips:

- **Keep copies** of everything (completion letter, transcripts, PGWP approval, employment records)
- **Create a folder** with all immigration documents organized by type
- **Check IRCC website regularly** for updates to PGWP, Express Entry, and PNP programs
- **Connect with other international students** at York; many have gone through this process
- **Use IRCC's online tools** (CRS calculator, NOC lookup, OINP stream selector) to understand your options
- **Monitor Ontario news** for OINP updates (new healthcare stream expected late 2025/2026)
- **Don't rush into jobs** just for the sake of it; prioritize roles that match your education and PR goals
- **Consider networking in healthcare** to find job offers, especially for OINP employer job offer stream
